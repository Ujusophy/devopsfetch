# Devopsfetch 
This is a monitoring tool that retrieves and logs various system activities such as active ports, Docker containers, Nginx configurations, and user information. It also supports time-based activity queries and logging to a file with rotation.

# Step-by-step guide to install and configure DevOpsFetch
1. Install Dependencies
Ensure your system has the necessary dependencies installed. These include bash, curl, and docker. 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y bash curl docker.io
```
3. Download and Install DevOpsFetch Script
- Save the devopsfetch.sh script to a directory where you keep executable scripts, such as /usr/local/bin. Use curl or wget to download it.
```
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/devopsfetch.sh https://example.com/devopsfetch.sh
```
- Replace https://script.com/devopsfetch.sh with the actual URL where the script is hosted.

4. Make the Script Executable

- Set the executable permission for the script:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/devopsfetch.sh
```
5. Set Up Systemd Service
- Create a new file /etc/systemd/system/devopsfetch.service with the following content
```bash
[Unit]
Description=DevOpsFetch Monitoring Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/devopsfetch.sh -p
Restart=always
User=vagrant

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
This configuration ensures that DevOpsFetch starts after the network is available and restarts automatically if it fails.

6. Reload Systemd and Enable Service:

- After creating the service file, reload the systemd configuration and enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable devopsfetch.service
sudo systemctl start devopsfetch.service
```
7. Verify the Installation
- Check Service Status
```bash
sudo systemctl status devopsfetch.service
```
You should see an output indicating that the service is active and running.

8. Check for Errors:

- If there are issues, you can check the logs to diagnose problems:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u devopsfetch.service
```
You have successfully installed DevOpsFetch and configured it to run as a systemd service.

Logging Mechanism and How to Retrieve Logs
The devopsfetch script includes a logging mechanism that logs activities and outputs to a log file located at /var/log/devopsfetch.log. This log file records each time a command is run, capturing the output of the script and any errors that occur during its execution. The log rotation is handled using the logrotate utility to ensure that the log file does not grow too large and remains manageable.The configuration file for logrotate is typically found at /etc/logrotate.d/devopsfetch.

- View the Latest Logs
```bash
tail -f /var/log/devopsfetch.log
```
- View the Entire Log File
```bash
cat /var/log/devopsfetch.log
```
- Search for Specific Entries
```bash
grep "keyword" /var/log/devopsfetch.log
```
- Archived Logs
```bash
zless /var/log/devopsfetch.log.1.gz
```
These steps and examples should help users understand how to retrieve and manage logs generated by the devopsfetch script.
